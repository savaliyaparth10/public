                        Welcome to the Return Policy of GTikit, the premier

                        As a general rule, all sales made on our website and
                        mobile app are final. We do not offer refunds or
                        exchanges on any tickets purchased, except in the case
                        where the event has been canceled by the organizer. In
                        such instances, we will provide a full refund of the
                        ticket price paid by the customer.

                        postponed, or relocated, the ticket purchased will still
                        be valid for the new date, time, or location. If,
                        however, the customer is unable to attend the new event
                        date, we will not offer refunds or exchanges.

                    At GTikit, we aim to provide clarity about our return policy.
                    Here's what you need to know:
                    <br />
                    Vouchers for Local Services: Your GTikit Offer voucher is intended to be redeemed at the merchant's establishment for the specified value. However, please be aware that the merchant's individual refund policy takes precedence. For information regarding refunds, kindly refer to the merchant's specific refund policy as outlined in their Fine Print.
                    Goods: In the case of goods purchased through GTikit Offer, please consult the offer's Fine Print for any return instructions or exceptions. The following guidelines generally apply:
                    <br />
                    <ul className="list-unstyled">
                        <p className="mt-3">Unless the merchant's Fine Print states otherwise, all sales are considered final for goods acquired through GTikit Offer. This implies that, by default, refunds and returns are not typically accommodated, and all purchases become non-refundable upon completion.</p>
                    </ul>
                    Please recognize that the merchant's Fine Print and return policy hold higher priority over our general policy. We encourage you to thoroughly review the Fine Print of the specific offer for any additional return details.
                    <p><br /> If you have inquiries or concerns regarding the return process or a specific GTikit Offer, please don't hesitate to contact our dedicated customer support team. We are here to assist you in the best possible manner.</p>
